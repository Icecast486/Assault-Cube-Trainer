A simple trainer for AssaultCube 1.3.0.2. I plan on making other trainers later, but for right now i'm gonna keep it simple as AssaultCube is a 
very simple game to reverse.

This is a repository im using to practice game hacking and reverse engineering and to overall keep track of the changes I make to the project. :)
